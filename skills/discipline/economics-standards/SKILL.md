## When to Use

- When conducting empirical economics research (micro, macro, applied)
- When specifying and estimating econometric models
- When designing causal identification strategies
- When preparing regression tables and results for publication
- When writing or reviewing NBER working papers
- When submitting to AEA journals (AER, AEJ, JEP, JEL)
- When working with panel data, time series, or cross-sectional datasets
- When pre-registering randomized controlled trials or field experiments
- When preparing replication packages for journal submission

---

## Protocol

### 1. Research Standards

#### 1.1 Citation and Style

1. **Chicago Manual of Style (Author-Date)** -- the dominant citation style in economics
   - In-text: (Acemoglu & Robinson, 2012)
   - Bibliography: Acemoglu, Daron, and James A. Robinson. 2012. *Why Nations Fail*. New York: Crown.
2. **Journal-specific styles** -- always check the target journal's style guide; AER, QJE, Econometrica, and JPE each have minor variations
3. **BibTeX** -- use `@article`, `@book`, `@techreport` (for working papers), and `@incollection` (for handbook chapters); maintain a clean `.bib` file
4. **Working paper convention** -- cite as "(Author, Year)" with the working paper number; update citations to published versions before final submission

#### 1.2 NBER Working Paper Conventions

1. Include NBER working paper number prominently
2. Add the JEL classification codes (e.g., C23, D72, O15)
3. Include a structured abstract (250 words or fewer for most journals)
4. Acknowledge funding sources, data providers, and seminar participants
5. Standard disclaimer: "The views expressed herein are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Bureau of Economic Research."

#### 1.3 AEA (American Economic Association) Guidelines

1. **Data and Code Availability Policy** -- mandatory for all AEA journals since 2019
   - Submit a complete replication package to the AEA Data and Code Repository (openICPSR)
   - Include all code, data (or instructions to obtain restricted data), and a README
   - README must follow the AEA template (see references)
2. **Pre-registration** -- encouraged for experimental and quasi-experimental work
   - AEA RCT Registry (https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/) for RCTs
   - EGAP registry or OSF for observational studies
   - Pre-analysis plans should specify primary outcomes, sample, and estimation strategy
3. **Disclosure policy** -- authors must disclose funding sources, relevant financial relationships, and IRB approvals
4. **Data availability statements** -- mandatory for top journals; specify whether data are public, restricted, proprietary, or confidential

#### 1.4 Manuscript Structure (Empirical Papers)

Standard ordering for an empirical economics paper:
1. Introduction (motivation, contribution, preview of results)
2. Background / Institutional Context
3. Data (sources, construction, summary statistics)
4. Empirical Strategy / Identification
5. Results (main estimates, interpretation)
6. Robustness Checks and Extensions
7. Conclusion
8. References
9. Appendix (additional tables, proofs, data details)

### 2. Methodology Conventions

#### 2.1 Causal Identification Strategies

The credibility revolution in economics demands explicit identification of causal effects. Common strategies:

| Strategy | Key Assumption | Diagnostic Tests |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Instrumental Variables (IV)** | Exclusion restriction; relevance | First-stage F-statistic (F > 10); overidentification tests (Hansen J) |
| **Regression Discontinuity (RDD)** | Continuity of potential outcomes at cutoff | McCrary density test; covariate balance at cutoff; bandwidth sensitivity |
| **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** | Parallel trends in absence of treatment | Pre-treatment trend plots; event study coefficients; placebo tests |
| **Synthetic Control** | Pre-treatment fit quality | RMSPE ratios; placebo tests (in-space, in-time) |
| **Natural Experiments** | As-if random assignment | Balance tests; institutional narrative |
| **Propensity Score Methods** | Conditional independence (selection on observables) | Covariate balance after matching; sensitivity analysis (Rosenbaum bounds) |

#### 2.2 Panel Data Methods

1. **Fixed Effects (FE)** -- absorbs time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity
   - Use entity and/or time fixed effects
   - Cluster standard errors at the entity level (or the level of treatment variation)
   - Report within R-squared
2. **Random Effects (RE)** -- assumes unobserved effects are uncorrelated with regressors
   - More efficient than FE when the assumption holds
   - **Hausman test** -- compare FE and RE estimates; reject RE if they differ systematically
3. **Correlated Random Effects (CRE / Mundlak)** -- include group means of time-varying regressors to relax the RE assumption
4. **Two-way fixed effects (TWFE)** -- caution with staggered treatment timing; use modern DiD estimators (Callaway & Sant'Anna 2021; Sun & Abraham 2021; de Chaisemartin & d'Haultfoeuille 2020)
5. **Dynamic panels** -- Arellano-Bond / Blundell-Bond GMM for short T, large N panels with lagged dependent variables

#### 2.3 Time Series Methods

1. **Stationarity** -- test with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron, or KPSS tests before modeling
2. **Cointegration** -- Engle-Granger two-step or Johansen test for long-run relationships among I(1) variables
3. **VAR/VECM** -- Vector Autoregression for reduced-form dynamics; Vector Error Correction Model when cointegration is present
   - Report impulse response functions (IRFs) with confidence bands
   - Granger causality tests for directional relationships
4. **Structural VARs (SVARs)** -- impose identification restrictions (Cholesky, sign restrictions, narrative identification)
5. **ARCH/GARCH** -- for modeling volatility clustering in financial time series
6. **Local projections (Jorda, 2005)** -- flexible alternative to VAR-based IRFs; robust to misspecification

#### 2.4 Structural vs. Reduced-Form

- **Reduced-form** -- estimates causal effects without specifying a full economic model; transparent, easy to interpret, but limited in counterfactual analysis
- **Structural estimation** -- specifies and estimates an economic model (utility functions, production functions, equilibrium conditions); allows counterfactual simulations but depends on model assumptions
- Many papers now combine both: reduced-form evidence for causal effects + structural model for welfare/counterfactual analysis
- When using structural models, clearly state all assumptions, the estimation method (MLE, GMM, simulated method of moments), and provide model fit diagnostics

#### 2.5 Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs

1. **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**
   - Pre-register on the AEA RCT Registry
   - Report CONSORT-style flow diagrams
   - Analyze by intention-to-treat (ITT) as the primary specification
   - Report treatment-on-the-treated (TOT/LATE) using random assignment as an instrument for take-up
   - Account for multiple hypothesis testing (Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, or Westfall-Young)
2. **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)**
   - Plot the raw data around the discontinuity
   - Use local polynomial regression (triangular kernel preferred)
   - Report estimates across multiple bandwidths (optimal bandwidth via Calonico, Cattaneo, & Titiunik 2014)
   - Run McCrary (2008) density test to check for manipulation
   - Test for covariate smoothness at the cutoff
3. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
   - Plot pre-treatment trends for treatment and control groups
   - Include event study specification with leads and lags
   - Test for pre-trends (joint significance of pre-treatment coefficients)
   - For staggered adoption: use Callaway-Sant'Anna, Sun-Abraham, or Borusyak-Jaravel-Spiess estimators

### 3. Econometric Reporting

#### 3.1 Regression Tables

Economics has highly specific conventions for presenting regression results:

1. **Standard errors in parentheses** below the coefficient estimate -- never report t-statistics in parentheses (some journals accept brackets for t-statistics; always clarify in a table note)
2. **Significance stars** -- use the standard notation:
   - \* p < 0.10
   - \*\* p < 0.05
   - \*\*\* p < 0.01
   - Include a note at the bottom of every table: "Standard errors in parentheses. \* p < 0.10, \*\* p < 0.05, \*\*\* p < 0.01."
3. **Multiple specifications** -- present results across columns, progressively adding controls:
   - Column (1): Bivariate regression
   - Column (2): Add demographic controls
   - Column (3): Add fixed effects
   - Column (4): Preferred specification
   - Column (5): Robustness (alternative sample, specification, or estimator)
4. **Bottom-panel statistics** -- report at the bottom of each table:
   - Number of observations (N)
   - R-squared (or adjusted R-squared, or within R-squared for FE)
   - Fixed effects included (entity, time, entity x time)
   - Clustering level for standard errors
   - First-stage F-statistic (for IV regressions)
   - Dependent variable mean (useful for interpreting effect sizes)
5. **Formatting**
   - Use `stargazer` (R), `esttab`/`estout` (Stata), or `fixest::etable` (R) for consistent table generation
   - Align decimal points across columns
   - Use consistent number of decimal places (typically 3 for coefficients, 3 for standard errors)
   - Label variables with readable names, not variable codes

#### 3.2 Example Table Format

```
Table 3: Effect of Minimum Wage on Employment

                           (1)        (2)        (3)        (4)
                          OLS        OLS        FE         IV

Log(minimum wage)       -0.152**   -0.134**   -0.098*    -0.215**
                        (0.061)    (0.058)    (0.052)    (0.089)

Controls                  No        Yes        Yes        Yes
State fixed effects       No         No        Yes        Yes
Year fixed effects        No         No        Yes        Yes
Observations            1,530      1,530      1,530      1,530
R-squared               0.043      0.127      0.891      0.887
First-stage F                                             23.4
Dependent variable mean  4.82       4.82       4.82       4.82

Notes: Standard errors clustered at the state level in parentheses.
* p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01. The dependent variable is
log(employment). Column (4) instruments for log(minimum wage) using
the interaction of federal minimum wage changes with state-level
exposure.
```

#### 3.3 Robust and Clustered Standard Errors

1. **Always specify the type of standard errors** -- never report uncorrected OLS standard errors without justification
2. **Heteroskedasticity-robust (HC)** -- use HC1 (Stata default) or HC2/HC3 for small samples
3. **Cluster-robust standard errors** -- cluster at the level of treatment variation:
   - State-level policy: cluster at state level
   - Individual-level treatment in a school: cluster at school level
   - Firm-level event: cluster at firm level
4. **Two-way clustering** -- when error correlation occurs along two dimensions (e.g., firm and year), use Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller (2011) two-way clustering
5. **Few clusters problem** -- if fewer than ~40 clusters, standard cluster-robust errors are unreliable:
   - Use wild cluster bootstrap (Cameron, Gelbach, & Miller 2008)
   - Or use the effective number of clusters correction (Imbens & Kolesar 2016)
6. **Conley standard errors** -- for spatial correlation in cross-sectional data

#### 3.4 IV-Specific Reporting

1. **First-stage regression** -- always report; include the first-stage F-statistic
2. **Staiger-Stock rule of thumb** -- F > 10 for a single endogenous regressor; for multiple instruments, use the Stock-Yogo critical values or the effective F-statistic (Olea & Pflueger 2013)
3. **Weak instrument diagnostics** -- report Anderson-Rubin confidence intervals if the instrument is potentially weak
4. **Overidentification test** -- Hansen J test when there are more instruments than endogenous regressors
5. **Reduced-form** -- present the reduced-form (regress outcome on instrument) alongside 2SLS; if the reduced form is not significant, the IV result is suspect
6. **Report both OLS and IV** -- compare to assess the direction and magnitude of endogeneity bias

### 4. Common Methods

#### 4.1 Core Estimation Methods

| Method | When to Use | Key Assumptions | Software |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|----------|
| **OLS** | Linear relationships, exogenous regressors | E[u\|X] = 0, homoskedasticity (or use robust SEs) | Stata: `reg`; R: `lm()`, `fixest::feols()` |
| **2SLS / IV** | Endogenous regressor with valid instrument | Relevance, exclusion restriction | Stata: `ivregress 2sls`; R: `ivreg()`, `fixest::feols()` |
| **LIML** | IV with potentially weak instruments | Same as 2SLS but less bias with weak instruments | Stata: `ivregress liml`; R: `ivreg(method="LIML")` |
| **DiD** | Treatment and control groups, pre/post periods | Parallel trends | Stata: `did_multiplegt`, `csdid`; R: `did`, `fixest` |
| **RDD** | Treatment assigned by a running variable cutoff | Continuity at cutoff | Stata: `rdrobust`; R: `rdrobust` |
| **Propensity Score Matching** | Selection on observables | Conditional independence, common support | Stata: `psmatch2`, `teffects`; R: `MatchIt` |
| **Quantile Regression** | Heterogeneous effects across the outcome distribution | Correctly specified conditional quantile | Stata: `qreg`; R: `quantreg` |
| **MLE** | Discrete choice, structural models, censored/truncated data | Correctly specified likelihood | Stata: `ml`; R: `maxLik`, `optim()` |
| **GMM** | Overidentified models, dynamic panels | Moment conditions valid | Stata: `gmm`, `xtabond2`; R: `gmm`, `plm` |
| **Tobit** | Censored dependent variable (e.g., hours worked >= 0) | Normal, homoskedastic errors | Stata: `tobit`; R: `censReg`, `AER::tobit()` |
| **Heckman Selection** | Sample selection bias (observed only if selected) | Exclusion restriction in selection equation | Stata: `heckman`; R: `sampleSelection` |

#### 4.2 Robustness Check Checklist

For any empirical paper, standard robustness checks include:
- [ ] Alternative functional forms (log vs. level, quadratic terms)
- [ ] Alternative control variable sets (add/remove controls)
- [ ] Alternative sample restrictions (trim outliers, exclude subgroups)
- [ ] Alternative standard error specifications (robust, clustered at different levels)
- [ ] Alternative estimators (OLS vs. IV, parametric vs. nonparametric)
- [ ] Placebo tests (fake treatment timing, fake treatment groups)
- [ ] Leave-one-out analysis (drop one state/country/sector at a time)
- [ ] Sensitivity to outliers (winsorize at 1%/99%, Cook's distance)
- [ ] Bounding exercises (Oster 2019 for omitted variable bias; Conley, Hansen, & Rossi 2012 for IV)

### 5. Data Standards

#### 5.1 Reproducibility Requirements

1. **Replication package** -- must include:
   - All code (numbered or clearly ordered scripts)
   - Raw data or clear instructions for obtaining restricted/proprietary data
   - A master script that runs everything from raw data to final tables and figures
   - A README following the AEA template (data sources, computational requirements, instructions)
2. **Software documentation** -- specify exact versions:
   - Stata: version number + all user-written packages with version (`ssc install ...`)
   - R: `sessionInfo()` or `renv` lockfile
   - Python: `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
3. **Runtime estimates** -- state how long the code takes to run and on what hardware
4. **Random seed** -- set and document seeds for any stochastic procedure (bootstrap, simulation, MCMC)

#### 5.2 Code Standards

1. **Stata .do files** -- the traditional workhorse of empirical economics
   - Use `version XX` at the top of the master .do file
   - Use relative file paths from a project root
   - Comment extensively; use section headers
   - Log output: `log using "output/main_results.log", replace`
2. **R scripts** -- increasingly common, especially for visualization and newer econometric methods
   - Use R projects (`.Rproj`) for path management
   - Prefer `fixest` for fixed effects estimation (fast, flexible)
   - Use `modelsummary` or `stargazer` for table generation
3. **Python** -- growing presence for machine learning, NLP in economics, and large-scale data processing
   - Use `linearmodels` for panel data, `statsmodels` for core econometrics
   - Jupyter notebooks for exploration; `.py` scripts for production code
4. **File organization**:
   ```
   project/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── raw/          # Never modify raw data
   │   ├── processed/    # Cleaned and merged datasets
   │   └── README.md     # Data dictionary and sources
   ├── code/
   │   ├── 01_clean.do
   │   ├── 02_merge.do
   │   ├── 03_analysis.do
   │   ├── 04_tables.do
   │   └── 05_figures.do
   ├── output/
   │   ├── tables/
   │   └── figures/
   ├── paper/
   │   └── manuscript.tex
   └── README.md
   ```

#### 5.3 FAIR Data Principles

1. **Findable** -- deposit data in a searchable repository with a DOI (openICPSR, Zenodo, Dataverse)
2. **Accessible** -- use open formats (CSV, Parquet) over proprietary ones (.dta is acceptable in economics but include CSV versions)
3. **Interoperable** -- use standard variable naming conventions; include a codebook
4. **Reusable** -- attach a clear license; document provenance and transformations

#### 5.4 Common Datasets in Economics

| Dataset | Coverage | Access | Common Uses |
|---------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **PSID** (Panel Study of Income Dynamics) | US households, 1968-present | Restricted (free registration) | Income dynamics, intergenerational mobility |
| **CPS** (Current Population Survey) | US labor force, monthly | Public (IPUMS-CPS) | Labor economics, wage analysis |
| **ACS** (American Community Survey) | US demographics, annual | Public (IPUMS-USA) | Regional analysis, immigration, housing |
| **World Bank WDI** | Country-level development indicators | Public | Development economics, cross-country analysis |
| **Penn World Table** | Cross-country GDP, productivity | Public | Growth economics, international comparisons |
| **Compustat / CRSP** | US firm financials / stock returns | Licensed (WRDS) | Corporate finance, asset pricing |
| **NLSY** (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth) | US youth cohorts (1979, 1997) | Public/restricted | Returns to education, labor market outcomes |
| **DHS** (Demographic and Health Surveys) | Developing countries, health + demographics | Public (registration) | Health economics, development |
| **LISS / Understanding Society** | Dutch / UK household panels | Public (registration) | Behavioral economics, labor, health |
| **World Values Survey** | Cross-country attitudes and values | Public | Institutional economics, culture |

### 6. Additional Conventions

#### 6.1 Figures

1. **Publication quality** -- use vector formats (PDF, EPS) for journal submission; minimum 300 DPI for rasters
2. **Binned scatter plots** -- the workhorse visualization in applied micro; use `binscatter` (Stata) or `binsreg` (Stata/R) for proper implementation with controls
3. **Event study plots** -- plot coefficients and 95% confidence intervals relative to treatment timing; normalize the period before treatment to zero
4. **RDD plots** -- show raw data with a fitted polynomial on each side of the cutoff; include the confidence interval
5. **Coefficient plots** -- preferred over tables for presenting many estimates; use `coefplot` (Stata) or `ggplot2::geom_pointrange` (R)
6. **Color and accessibility** -- use colorblind-friendly palettes; ensure figures are legible in grayscale

#### 6.2 JEL Classification Codes

Include 2-3 JEL codes with every paper. Common codes:

- **C** -- Mathematical and Quantitative Methods (C23: Panel Data Models; C26: IV)
- **D** -- Microeconomics (D12: Consumer Economics; D72: Political Processes)
- **E** -- Macroeconomics (E24: Employment; E52: Monetary Policy)
- **F** -- International Economics (F13: Trade Policy; F31: Foreign Exchange)
- **G** -- Financial Economics (G12: Asset Pricing; G21: Banks)
- **H** -- Public Economics (H23: Externalities; H75: State and Local Government)
- **I** -- Health, Education, Welfare (I12: Health Behavior; I26: Returns to Education)
- **J** -- Labor and Demographic Economics (J16: Gender; J31: Wage Level)
- **L** -- Industrial Organization (L11: Market Structure; L86: IT Services)
- **O** -- Economic Development (O15: Human Resources; O33: Technological Change)

#### 6.3 Authorship in Economics

1. **Author order** -- alphabetical ordering is the strong norm in economics (unlike most other social sciences)
   - Exceptions exist for very unequal contributions, but alphabetical is the default expectation
2. **Acknowledgments** -- thank seminar participants, conference discussants, referees, and editors by convention
3. **Working paper circulation** -- it is standard to circulate working papers (NBER, SSRN, CEPR) well before journal publication; most economics papers are cited in working paper form for years
